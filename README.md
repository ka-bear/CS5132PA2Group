# CS5132 PA2 Project - Pass It On Delivery System

## Welcome to Our Project! 🚗📦

Hello there! We are Kabir, Mahir and Hugo, and we've been working on a project that's close to our hearts. We've teamed up with the charitable organization, Pass It On, to create a system that helps get donated items to people who need them, using everyday routes of regular drivers. This means your daily commute to work could help a winter coat get to someone who really needs it!

## What's the Issue We're Addressing? 🌎

In a nutshell, getting donated items from A to B isn’t always smooth sailing. Sometimes, logistical hiccups mean that essential items can be delayed, which can be more than an inconvenience for someone in need - it can be a real hardship. We wanted to make sure that the spirit of giving isn’t lost in transit, and that’s where our project comes in.

## How Does It Work? 🤔

Imagine you're driving from your home to your workplace. Our application allows your route to be utilized for delivering donated items! It identifies potential delivery routes based on your everyday commutes, ensuring that donations get to their destinations quickly and efficiently. It’s a community-driven approach that not only optimizes delivery but also fosters a sense of shared responsibility among us all.
