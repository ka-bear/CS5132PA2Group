# Estimated Time of Arrival
# CS5132 PA2 Project - ETA

By Kabir, Hugo and Mahir
## Welcome to Our Project! üöóüì¶

## Description
Hello there! We are Kabir, Mahir and Hugo, and we've teamed up with the charitable organization, Pass It On, to create a system that helps get donated items to people who need them, using everyday routes of regular drivers. 

## What is ETA?

ETA is a JavaFX application we created to help charities deliver goods and groceries to vulnerable people by using the everyday route of drivers.

Users have to first input their daily route using our simple map ui. This route will be persisted for subsequent usage. They then are able to see all the paths given by charities, and are able to reserve the path with the lowest estimated time of arrival when taking that detour along with their daily route. Clicking on the RSVP button will give them a link for the route in Google Maps. To ensure that a driver will not misuse the system, they can only reserve one route and will have to finish that route to reserve another route.

There is also an interface for charities to put the routes using the interactive map. After inputting the route, it will be added to a priority queue, where the priority is the negative of the ETA of the total route.
## How Does It Work? ü§î

When driving from your home to your workplace. Our application allows your route to be utilized for delivering donated items! It identifies potential delivery routes based on your everyday commutes, ensuring that donations get to their destinations quickly and efficiently. It‚Äôs a community-driven approach that not only optimizes delivery but also fosters a sense of shared responsibility among us all.


## How to Contribute? ü§ù

We welcome contributions from everyone! Whether it's a bug report, new feature, or improvement, feel free to post issues and open pull requests anytime.

## Let‚Äôs Make a Difference Together! üíñ

We believe that technology, when used with purpose and empathy, can make a real impact on society. Through this application, we're not just solving a logistical problem but ensuring that the act of giving reaches its rightful destination.
